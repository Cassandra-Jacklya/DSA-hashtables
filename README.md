# DSA-hashtables

# Introduction
Specifically created to implement a hash table (closely related to the built in java hashmap)

# Motivation:
This project has been created for the main purpose of my lab practical requirements (Data Structures and Algorithm)

# Code Style
Programmed this project using Java programming language

$ javac *.java  
* this will be necessary as the files do not have its own class files yet  

$ java TestDSAHashTable  
* runs the test harness program  

Instantaneously goes to report mode upon running the program which will show the following:-  
- Reads the CSV file (RandomNames7000.csv in this case)
- Writing the hash keys and values into a csv file 
- Searching for specific keys
- Remove function testing

__TAKE NOTE:__ Do not add the file extension whenever filenames are prompted. Example:  
* RandomNames7000 _instead of_ RandomNames7000.csv
